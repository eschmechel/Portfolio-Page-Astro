Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm Elliott Schmechel sometimes know as Eragon in Game-dev spaces, a game programmer and developer passionate about creating engaging experiences through code.

## What You'll Find Here

In this blog, I'll be sharing:

- **Game Development Insights**: From Godot scripting tips to Unreal Engine plugins
- **Programming Tutorials**: Deep dives into C++, C#, and Linux
- **Technology Reviews**: My thoughts on new tools, frameworks, and technologies
- **Project Showcases**: Behind-the-scenes looks at my current and completed projects

## My Journey

I always desired to be a software Engineer since I was a little kid, wanting to follow in my dad's footsteps. I started programming at the age of 11, making Scratch games so my friends and I could play during lunch. Ultimately, I would love to combine the the intersection of Cybersecurity and Game Development and pursue a role in Anti-cheat development. Currently, I'm pursuing Computer Science at Langara College while working as an AI Red Teamer at Data Annotation.

## Current goals

Some projects I'm excited to share more about:

1. **Earn Cyber Certificates**: Working on my knowledge and skillset to pursue a <a href="https://www.comptia.org/en-us/certifications/security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Security+</a> certificate
2. **Unreal Engine Networking**: Currently developing a Networking plugin utilizing Steam's <abbr title="Peer to Peer">P2P</abbr> system, with seamless player replication geared for <abbr title="First Person Shooters">FPS</abbr>.
3. **Consolidate subdomains into a monorepo**: Move separate subdomain repositories into a single monorepo per domain once each is stable to simplify management and reduce duplication.
4. **Seeking Learning Opprutunities**: Attending more local events and workshops to gain insights from mentors and peers
